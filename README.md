# Wave Software Development Challenge

I used React Native (functional components with hooks) to create a cross-platform (Android & iOS) version of the app. I used the `axios` package for the HTTP client, and stored the source files in a "/src" folder to keep things organized. This is probably not necessary at this point, but for a production app it would be much needed. In a production app I would have stored the business ID and access token in a `process.env` file, but I left it in the source code so the app would be useable for those reviewing the app at Wave.

A few things I am proud of:

- Using the Wave logo as the app icon.
- Displaying the Wave logo in the header.
- Displaying an `ActivityIndicator` when fetching the products.

I really enjoyed working on this app and I look forward to discussing it with you soon.
