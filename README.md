Wave Software Development Challenge Submission

Despite this app having only 1 simple feature, I have set up the structure of this app as if it would have dozen of View Controllers and dozens of Model objects. 

I am like to architect the app to be as loosely-coupled as possible and relies heavily on the Factory design pattern. Almost all Classes in the project are created from a Factory class, which encapsulates all the dependency injection code. 

Overall I am most proud of the architecture of this app and I always strive to improve my knowledge of Design Patterns.

Thanks for reading
