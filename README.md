# Wave Code Challenge [Mobile Engineer - Android]

### Setting up
1. Import the project into Android Studio
  * Clone the project and then import: File -> New -> Import Project...
  * Alternatively, you can directly import GitHub projects into Android Studio: 
     File -> New -> Project from Version Control -> GitHub. (Git Repo URL: https://github.com/EhanJin/mobile-challenge.git)
2. Run the project: Run -> Run 'app'
3. Once it starts, it will automatically fetch the list of products for the specific business ID, and also you can tap the "refresh" icon
3. Tap on each list item to view the detail information of the product.
  
### Highlights
* Tried not to use any third-party libraries to demonstrate pure Android framework development skill
  1. Get HTTP request for the product list
  2. Parse JSON into proper classes (Product, Account)   
* Implemented Pop-up dialog to show the detail information of the product
* Tested on Samsung Galaxy Tab4 & Note3
