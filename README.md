# Wave Software Development Challenge

A simple implementation using native android tools without using any third party library. 

### Proud of!
Managed to take this application a step further in a short amount of time by implementing a small functionality of calculating the total. The app counts the sum by adding the values of selected item. It also saves the state of selection so that the selected items are not lost when the device is rotated. 

## Setting up and running your application
Clone the repository into your local machine and open the project using android studio.
OR
Add the project directly into android studio by selecting VCS -> Checkout from version control -> Github (Not Tested)
