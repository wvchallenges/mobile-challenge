I liked the project's division of responsibility because in that division I could easily test all the business rules inside the view models folder.

## Configuration
1. Clone (Download) source code
2. Install cocoapods
```
cd path/project folder
pod install
```
If you don't have cocoapods installed follow instructions in this link

http://cocoapods.org/
```
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

3. Open wave.xcworkspace

Run the app
