# To run the application

2. Choose any simulator (iphone, ipad) to run the project

## About my implementation 
1. Totally object oriented and following MVC style, fetch data in a separate manager class (WaveAPIManager), convert the response into WaveProduct objects.
2. Using Swift 2.0, some of those swift features, such as "didSet" observer, "??" optional condition checking, the code is neat and clean.
3. Because of auto layout, the app supports both iPhone and iPad in any orientation.
