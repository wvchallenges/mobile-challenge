# Wave Software Development Challenge
## Proud of
Since I have to work during daytime, I did this project in my spare time during the past 3 days - about 4 hours. There're two points I am really proud of in my code:

1. My architecture is clear by sticking to MVC.
2. I wrote the test case before the implementation of the tested function, though it was only a small part due to time limited.

## Setting up
I uesd CocoaPods to manage the third party frameworks. So to use my project, you need to install CocoaPods. To install  CocoaPods: `$ sudo gem install cocoapods`
 
Then use it to install frameworks.The command line of using pods to install frameworks is`$ pod install`, also you can find help documents on
```
https://cocoapods.org/
```

As I wrote this app in Swift 3, you will need to update your Xcode to 8.x to build this project.
