# WaveTest

## Synopsis
Simple iPhone app that provides Wave users with the products that they can charge for on their invoices. This is a sample technical project that was completed in ~2 hours as an exercise.

## Deployment Info
This app is built for iOS 9.2+

## Installation
`git clone https://github.com/danielgrenzowski/mobile-challenge.git`

## What I'm Particularly Proud Of
The clean, simple UI is nice. Also, the API requests are always sent in the background so as not to hold up the flow of the app.

## Test Coverage
1. _testAsynchronousFetchForJSONFromWaveDeveloperAPI_ - Tests the Wave Developer API by requesting an array of JSON objects on a background thread
