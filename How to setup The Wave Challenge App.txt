How to setup The Wave Challenge App:
Use Cocoapods in your terminal and run pip install 
If you do not have cocoa pods
https://cocoapods.org/
Install the dependencies and then
open the xcworkspace <--- This is important
Build and Run with an iOS device <--- important
The reason for running with a device, the simulator is breaking my code, my storyboard code anyways.

However it works just fine on my device.
The implementation uses MVVM (model view view model) cleanly separates the layers of the application and make's parts of the app easy to update, its a simple app, I would add more to it that is CRUD features however I don't have a spec for that, so I would likely box myself in if I was to continue. I also wanted to add animations and such but due to time contraints on my end I didn't have enough time to.
